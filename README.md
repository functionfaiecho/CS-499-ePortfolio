# CS 499 - Computer Science Capstone

Welcome to my CS 499 - Computer Science Capstone repository. This ePortfolio was put together as part of the final course of my computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University. It will feature three artifacts that showcase my skills in:
- Software Engineering & Design;
- Data Structures and Algorithms; and
- Databases.

The complete ePortfolio can be found on [this link](cs499.crabcakes.dev).


Each artifact is placed in its own repository. The respective repositories all contain detailed README files on how to clone and run each file on your computer. **Please note that the API may not be cloned or run on your computer, but may be accessed through the link provided**.
