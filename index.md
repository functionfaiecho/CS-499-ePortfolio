## Introduction

Hello!üëãüèº My name is Fai. Two years ago, I began my Computer Science program at my university after a long journey of contemplating on the many career choices that were made available to me. My undergraduate degree took me across three different countries, two separate careers and also encompassed several milestones which I thought I would never have achieved, but am proud to say that I have done so today.

## Professional Summary

My degree program and coursework have helped me to develop myself holistically towards my desired career in software engineering and academia. It has led me to appreciate the importance of reviewing and polishing my work in a manner befitting a professional environment. Through the various courses, I learned to develop my communication skills, work with people from all walks of life, become a good team leader as well as an efficient team member. My technical skills in particular have gone from simple code to complex programs that involve separation of concerns, using APIs and also automation for certain tasks. I can truly say that I have become a more confident programmer, and I am less hesitant to attempt to use my skills in tasks that I find would warrant their requirement, even if they don't always work out at first try.

Whilst I was enrolled in **CS 250 - Software Development Lifecycle**, I was able to practice (even as a certified Scrum Master) and gain a solid understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle and the importance of working and collaborating in a team environment. During the class, I took on the role of scrum master, product owner, tester and developer while working alongside some of my classmates to contribute towards the success of a particular project. The lessons learned showed me the importance of the different roles within a development team (perhaps more than my Scrum Master course would have taught me) and how crucial it is to coordinate, collaborate and communicate with all members of the team as well as with stakeholders. This was particularly important as we had deadlines to meet
