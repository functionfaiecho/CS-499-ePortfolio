## Introduction

Hello!üëãüèº My name is Fai. Two years ago, I began my Computer Science program at my university after a long journey of contemplating on the many career choices that were made available to me. My undergraduate degree took me across three different countries, two separate careers and also encompassed several milestones which I thought I would never have achieved, but am proud to say that I have done so today.

## Professional Summary

My degree program and coursework have helped me to develop myself holistically towards my desired career in software engineering and academia. It has led me to appreciate the importance of reviewing and polishing my work in a manner befitting a professional environment. Through the various courses, I learned to develop my communication skills, work with people from all walks of life, become a good team leader as well as an efficient team member. My technical skills in particular have gone from simple code to complex programs that involve separation of concerns, using APIs and also automation for certain tasks. I can truly say that I have become a more confident programmer, and I am less hesitant to attempt to use my skills in tasks that I find would warrant their requirement, even if they don't always work out at first try.

Whilst I was enrolled in **CS 250 - Software Development Lifecycle**, I was able to practice (even as a certified Scrum Master) and gain a solid understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle and the importance of working and collaborating in a team environment. During the class, I took on the role of scrum master, product owner, tester and developer while working alongside some of my classmates to contribute towards the success of a particular project. The lessons learned showed me the importance of the different roles within a development team (perhaps more than my Scrum Master course would have taught me) and how crucial it is to coordinate, collaborate and communicate with all members of the team as well as with stakeholders. This was particularly important as we had deadlines to meet collectively. 

**IT 140 - Introduction To Scripting** was a basic class that introduced me to how Python works. Databases and Algorithms were a self-learning process, particularly when combining MAT230 - Discrete Mathematics with it. I learned about linked-lists and search algorithms, among other techniques. Learning and practicing these different types of data structures and algorithms helped me to save time, energy and resources. I also developed a rather unprecedented appreciation for Discrete Math, which I had a slight disdain for early on in the course, which was an achievement in itself.

In software engineering, the most prominent concern is to keep my code safe. In **CS 340 - Client/Server Development**, **CS 305 - Software Security** and **CS 465 - Full Stack Development**, I learned how to develop applications securely from development stage to production stage, while keeping my code and data secure. I was introduced to working with databases in MongoDB, securing them so only specific users with credentials and authentication tokens may make the changes like Create, Update and Delete. In CS 305, I was given a glimpse into cybersecurity and how to handle hash keys, which played a small role in my decision to hash my passwords, and possibly even contributed in part to why passwords actually make me

Securing information in databases is an important part of software development, so special attention needs to be given to doing so in order to protect the team and intellectual property where applicable.

My ePortfolio constitutes three artifacts of work from different points in my degree program, one for each category that was required - Software Engineering and Design, Algorithms and Data Structure and Databases. It provides a small yet holistic, though not extensive view of my skills as a software engineer and my understanding of the three categories.



## Code Review
Please find my code review video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysbxu3AzL4w).

## Enhancement One: Software Engineering & Design
This artifact turned a C++ static clock application  from CS 210 - Programming Langauges into a more user-friendly and accessible web application written in Next JS 14, Tailwind and TypeScript. The clock is controlled manually through user input, manipulating a 12 and 24-hour clock at the same time.

## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
This artifact improved on my Choose Your Own Adventure (Python) game, implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm and Depth-First Search (DFS) to create a cheat mode for the game, ultimately allowing players to interact with the game.

### Repository Link
Please find the link to the original and enhanced [Python Game](https://github.com/functionfaiecho/PythonGame) here.

## Enhancement Three: Databases
This artifact integrated a FastAPI through a MongoDB database to populate a travel website. The travel website itself was re-created in Next JS 14, Tailwind and TypeScript. I chose to use MongoDB due to its flexibility and seamless data flow (it's in JSON format). This means that I don't have to convert the data type and format when passing it through the API and database.

### Repository Link
Please find the link to my original and enhanced [Java Swing Application](https://github.com/functionfaiecho/CS-250-Software-Development-Lifecycle-Java-Website) here.

You will also find the API (created in FastAPI from a MongoDB database) [here](https://github.com/functionfaiecho/CountryAPI).
